        NMAP is a free open source networking tool that helps to discover hosts and services running 
        in the target computer by sending and analyzing packets. 
        What exactly is a port?
        Port is a virtual concept. Its a point where connections start and end. Each port is 
        associated with a protocol. Its like a door through which only certain protocols have entry 
        and these doors are numbered. For example, while emails(SMTP, POP3 etc) go through a port, 
        websites are connected through another port for http. 
        
        <b>WHAT ARE THE MAIN FUNCTIONALITIES OF NMAP?</b><br><Br>
        <ul><li> NMAP  can provide useful information about the target users, including the device 
            specifications like MAC specifications.</li>
           
            <li>It can list the alive hosts on the network by analyzing the response to TCP/ICMP 
            packets.</li>
            <li>It can list out all the open ports on the target computer or the network.</li>
            <li>OS detection– performing an nmap can find the specifications about the OS and the 
            hardware characteristics.</li>
            <li>Version detection – it can identify the service application and version of the 
            application thet is being used currently.</li>
            <li>Scripts – it provides a number of simple scripts to automate a lot of network tasks 
            like brute forcing, bypassing authentication, DOS attacks, exploits etc.</li>
        </ul>

        MAIN COMMANDS<br><br>
        OS DETECTION 
        </b>
        NMAP's one of the best features is <i>os detection</i>
        its achieved using tcp/ip stack fingerprinting. this is done by the tcp/ip fingerprinting by 
        setting flags that different os and versions reply to differently. numerous tcp packets are 
        sent and the responses are compared to the base cases from the nmap-os-db fingerprints and the
         os id determined. each of these fingerprints contains the description of the os, and 
         additional informations like the vendor, underlying os, generation, device type aslo a cpe 
         representation.
         <br>
         <br>
        
        Lets see some of the most used flags:<br>
        
        -o - this flag is used to enable os detection. <br>
        
        --osscan-limit - usually, the os scan is done effectively when there is atleast one open and 
        one closed TCP port are present. with this flag, we can limit the detection preocesses to the 
        targets that pass these criterias. <br>
        
        --osscan-guess - as the name suggests, nmap guesses the os if it cant find a near-perfect 
        match. this flag along with --fuzzy helps the tool to guess the os more aggressively. <br>
        
        --max-os-tries - when nmap fails to find a match for the match, the attempt to find it is 
        repeated. when this flag value is dset to 1, or any lower value, this attempt is sped up. But 
        by doing this, we are actually restricting the tool to skip over some of the trials where there
        are better chances of finding the os details. so usually, the value is set to a higher value.
